Installs and manages zendserver

Adapted from 5UbZ3r0/httpd module

We very much liked the functionality of the module 5UbZ3r0/httpd however we are running zendserver-ce so we created this module to bring the functionality of 5UbZ3r0/httpd to our zendserver installations and added some additional functionality of our own.

Examples:

	zendserver{"zendserverinstall":
		webportalpassword=>\'examplepassword\'
	}

	# sets up ssl
	class {\'zendserver::ssl\':
		require=>Zendserver["zendserverinstall"]
	}
	
	


This module has been tested in debian squeeze. It requires modifications and testing to work in other flavors of linux -- the code contains placeholders for where these changes would need to be made. If you would like to contribute the code to enable these other flavors please let us know.
